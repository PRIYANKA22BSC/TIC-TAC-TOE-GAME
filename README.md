# Tic-Tac-Toe Game
Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe game! This project is a simple, browser-based implementation of the classic two-player game, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
## Overview
Tic-Tac-Toe is a game where two players take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

This version of Tic-Tac-Toe is built using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for game logic and interactivity.

## Features
- Two-player mode: Two players can take turns on the same device.
- Real-time updates: Game state is updated immediately when a player makes a move.
- Winner detection: The game checks for winners or a draw after every move.
- Reset button: Players can reset the game and start over.
## Technologies Used
1. HTML5: For structuring the game grid and UI elements.
2. CSS3: For styling the game board, text, and layout.
3. JavaScript (ES6+): For implementing game logic and interactivity.
### How to Play
1. Open the game in your browser (you can host it locally or deploy it online).
2. The game starts with Player 1 (X) making the first move.
3. Players take turns clicking on an empty cell in the 3x3 grid.
4. The game checks if a player has won after every move.
5. If a player wins or the game results in a draw, the game will display the result.
6. Press the "Reset" button to start a new game.
